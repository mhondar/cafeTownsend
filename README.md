# cafeTownsend

The web app that needs to be tested is available under the following link:
http://thomasburleson.github.io/angularJS-CafeTownsend/#/login

## Features of the application:

1. The application allows you to login with a username and a password 
2. The application displays a list of employees in a café. Details about each
employee can be viewed by double clicking on the employee name
3. Employees can be added to the list of employees by adding their first
and last names, start date (format YYYY-MM-DD) and email
4. Employee data can be changed by clicking on Edit
5. Employee data can be deleted by clicking on Delete
6. Users can log out from the application

## What needs to be done:
● Prepare test cases for this application using any tool of your
choice.
● Please use any language or framework (preferably Selenium) of your
preference to automate the selection of the use cases.
● Provide such documentation that a layman could be able to checkout and
execute your project.
● Explain clearly how to launch the automated tests. Add the documentation to
the same repository as the other files. Preferably upload everything to
Bitbucket or Github or any code repository of your choice. If that is not
possible, please send all files in a zip-file.

## Hints:
● Make a choice as to what tests you want to automate and which not. (Since you
have limited time we advice you to do only a few and do them well instead of
large numbers.)
● Choose an implementation for the assignment (with or without a framework).
● Think about how you structure your code from a maintainability and reusability
perspective.
● Provide clear documentation on how to get the project running and explain your
thought process when working on it with respect to your test approach,
framework choice, tests covered, test results, like the decisions you made and
why you choose that solution?
